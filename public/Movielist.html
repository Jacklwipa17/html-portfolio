<h1>The Best Movies According to popular 80's choice</h1>
<hr />
<h2>My Personal top three are:</h2>

<h3>The terminator franchise</h3>

<p>This movie was one of my favorite or gateway to sci-fi movies</p>

<h3>Back to the future franchise</h3>

<p>
  This one is favorite mainly becuase of it's balance of Sci-fi and adventure
</p>

<h3>Texas Chainsaw</h3>

<p>
  This is probably what got me geeked about the slasher side of the horror genre
